Studies of the electron acoustic waves in kappa-distributed plasmas.

Suprathermal particles can significantly change the behaviors of plasma waves and instabilities.
The present work first studies the suprathermal effects on electron acoustic instabilities in plasmas with two kappa-distributed electron components.
It reveals that the suprathermalizations of different components play different roles in affecting the instabilities.
