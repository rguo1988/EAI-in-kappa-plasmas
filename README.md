Suprathermal particles can significantly change the behaviors of plasma waves and instabilities.
The present work studies the suprathermal effects on electron acoustic instabilities in plasmas with two kappa-distributed electron components.
It reveals that the suprathermalizations of different components play different roles in affecting the instabilities.
